# Custom keymaps for Blender 2.8x 

1. Download and install enter_edit_submode.py addon. This adds new operator to directly enter component edit modes from object mode. 
2. Download and install Keymap_RE_2.8x.py keymap

# Keymap_RE_2.80 Keymap
This is similar with my old 2.79 keymap, but with some key mappings taken from the new **Industry Standard keymap**. 
Biggest changes are with transformation tools:
**Grab is W
Rotate is E
Scale is R 
Box select is Q.** 

Select/Deselect all is **Ctrl + A**. 
Apply menu is **Return**

As well as some other changes.  
I did this to make main fuctions the same as in Industry Standard keymap, so it is easier to use that keymap on computers without this custom keymap. It's now more like extended industry standard keymap. 

Likely from now on, i will use and update only this one.

# Keymap_RE_2.81 
Updated keymap for Blender 2.81 (Daily builds). This is the most fresh one - includes new Outliner functionality.
Don't use it in 2.80!!



# Key changes from default or Industry Standard:
All viewport navigation shortcuts have been moved from numpad to regular number keys (Easier to reach with left hand and also on laptops with no numpads / tenkeyless keyboards ). 

Alt + 1,2,3  - directly enter vertex,edge,polygon edit modes from object mode.
